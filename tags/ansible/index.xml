This setup provides a production-like cluster that can be setup on your local machine. And we will use VirtualBox as the virtualization engine, Vagrant and Ansible for provisioning in our local environment. Before we setup kubernetes cluster, we need some prerequisities on our local machine below.

Designed for multi-tier deployments since day one, Ansible models your IT infrastructure by describing how all of your systems inter-relate, rather than just managing one system at a time.
It uses no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure, so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to deploy - and most importantly, it uses a very simple language (YAML, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allow you to describe your automation jobs in a way that approaches plain English.</description></item></channel></rss>
