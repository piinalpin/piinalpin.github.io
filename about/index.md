# About Me


Hello! I am __Alvinditya Saputra__. Backend Developer.

I like new things, interested in data science and have a high curiosity. Familiar with agile development and system development with Restful using __Object Relational Mapping__. If I have spare time I would rather research about __machine learning__ in the Python forum.
