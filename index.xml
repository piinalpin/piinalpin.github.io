    <description><![CDATA[Programmers use a command-line interface (CLI) to issue text-commands to the Operating System (OS), instead of clicking on a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This is because command-line inerface is much more powerful and flexible than the graphical user interface.
The Terminal application is a command-line Interface (or shell). By default, the Terminal in Ubuntu and macOS runs the so-called bash shell, which supports a set of commands and utilities; and has its own programming language for writing shell scripts.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks.
TCP is one of the basic standards that define the rules of the internet and is included within the standards defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It is one of the most commonly used protocols within digital network communications and ensures end-to-end data delivery.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine. Redis provides data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions, and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Redis Sentinel is the high-availability solution for open-source Redis server. It provides monitoring of all Redis nodes and automatic failover should the master node become unavailable. This guide provides a sample configuration for a three-node Redis cluster.
Sentinel itself is designed to run in a configuration where there are multiple Sentinel processes cooperating together. The advantage of having multiple Sentinel processes cooperating are the following :
Failure detection is performed when multiple Sentinels agree about the fact a given master is no longer available.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.
How Does Machine Learning Works? Similar to how the human brain gains knowledge and understanding, machine learning relies on input, such as training data or knowledge graphs, to understand entities, domains and the connections between them. With entities defined, deep learning can begin.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[An API gateway is an interface between clients and backend microservices. When a gateway is used, it becomes the single point of contact for clients; it receives their API calls and routes each one to the appropriate backend.
It facilitates microservice architectures. When an API gateway is used, clients do not know (nor should they know) the structure of the backend. Modern architectures discourage the use of large monolithic services; rather, numerous small microservices are preferred.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Continuous integration is a coding philosophy and set of practices that drive development teams to frequently implement small code changes and check them in to a version control repository. Most modern applications require developing code using a variety of platforms and tools, so teams need a consistent mechanism to integrate and validate changes. Continuous integration establishes an automated way to build, package, and test their applications. Having a consistent integration process encourages developers to commit code changes more frequently, which leads to better collaboration and code quality.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction Spring data JPA provides many ways to deal with entities including query methods and custom JPQL queries. However, sometimes we need a more programmatic approach: for example Criteria API or QueryDSL.
Spring Data JPA Specification provides a convenient and sophisticated manner to build dynamic SQL where clauses. By adding some extra logic and considering some pitfalls, we are capable of offering API consumers a zero-effort generic mechanism for filtering entities.]]></description>
